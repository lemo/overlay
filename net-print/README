Instalation of lpr-drivers works only if you are installing only one lpr-driver.
If you try to instal 2 or more, or if you have already one driver instaled, 
instalation will be failed.

TODO: to fix it.

Instalation of brother-laser2-cups-driver works fine only for DCP7030.
To install other drivers you have to change some things in pkg_postinst.
DCP7030 to "you printer" =)
But other drivers are not tested.(I have only one printer)

TODO: to fix it too. I'm too lazy, sorry =)
